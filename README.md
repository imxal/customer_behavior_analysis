## Data Analysis & Visualization Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data analytics workflow** completed by following a guided YouTube tutorial.  
The objective of the project is to analyze a dataset, extract meaningful insights, and present them through an interactive dashboard.

The project was completed on **macOS** and covers the full analytics lifecycle:
- Data loading and analysis using Python
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data cleaning
- SQL querying using PostgreSQL
- Data visualization using Tableau


## Dataset
- The dataset was loaded and processed using Python.
- Data was explored, cleaned, and prepared for analysis.
- Cleaned data was stored and queried in a PostgreSQL database.

## Project Steps
1. Loaded the dataset into **Python** using Pandas
2. Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis
4. Stored data and executed **SQL queries** on a PostgreSQL server
5. Extracted insights using SQL and Python
6. Built an **interactive Tableau dashboard** to visualize findings
